# Session Log

## 2026-02-23
- Added Obsidian AI workflow scripts under `em-portal/ops/` for setup, note creation, and edit-prompt generation.
- Added `status` filtering (`all/inbox/reviewed/published/unknown`) to major list pages in `tmp-app`.
- Added `status` display to `DocCard`; existing docs without status now fall back to `unknown`.
- Lint passed in `em-portal/tmp-app`.
- Added search-index `status` field and `/search` status filter UI.
- Regenerated `public/search-index.json` (currently 0 rows because content files are missing in this workspace state).
- Added `ops/Set-PortalContentStatus.ps1` for bulk status tagging of Obsidian content frontmatter (for use after content restore/sync).
- Researched ethnomethodology basics / CA resources on the web and created a Japanese starter content set (lesson, glossary, library, people, FAQ).
- Synced `test/em-portal/content` -> `em-portal/tmp-app/content`, regenerated search index (20 rows), and confirmed production build passes.
- Fixed mojibake text in `intro` page and `source-links` labels.
- Fixed remaining English/mixed UI labels on top/list/detail pages and status labels; rebuilt successfully.
- Added 10 figure description pages and expanded glossary to 16 core terms; search index now generates 40 rows.
- Added home page AI workflow shortcut section (Inbox / reviewed / published / search).
- Cleaned local `em-portal` worktree by restoring accidental `tmp-app/content` deletions and reverting a noisy `public/search-index.json` regeneration.
- Removed obsolete/untracked `ethnomethodology_portal_codex_instructions.md` (mojibake memo duplicate of WORKLOG usage notes).
- Expanded all `tmp-app/content/figures/*.md` detail pages with lesson-ready sections (`導入 / 活動 / 確認`) for classroom use.
- Hardened `tmp-app/src/lib/content.ts` and `tmp-app/scripts/generate-search-index.mjs` to strip UTF-8 BOM before parsing JSON/frontmatter (prevents build failures from PowerShell-saved files).
- Added classroom-ready concrete examples (school / SNS) to all figure detail pages to make explanations easier during lessons.
- Improved worksheet detail UI readability: added Japanese summary section (`所要時間 / 提出物 / 評価観点`) and fixed mojibake labels in shared doc cards.
- Simplified `library` list cards with a Japanese "文献概要" block and collapsible memo area; also fixed mojibake/metadata text in `content/library/lib-1.md`.
- Improved `glossary` readability: quick links now show Japanese term titles, detail pages include a Japanese summary block, and `accountability` text was de-mojibaked/refined.
- Fixed mojibake glossary entries `adjacency-pair` and `anonymization` with clean Japanese definitions/examples for classroom use.
- Cleaned residual UTF-8 BOM markers from `content/faq/faq-1.md` and `content/lessons/l1-what-is-em.md` (content unchanged, formatting hygiene).
- Replaced 14 placeholder glossary entries with Japanese classroom-ready definitions/examples (`context`, `data-session`, `deviation`, `embodiment`, `fieldnote`, `gaze`, `inference`, `institutional-talk`, `membership-categorization`, `norm`, `presentation`, `silence`, `topic-management`, `validity`).
- Standardized `faq-1` to `faq-10` into a consistent structure (`回答（短く） / 具体例（学校・SNS） / 注意点 / チェック`) and added missing `status` where needed.
- Improved `/faq` list readability: cards now show a short answer first, sort by FAQ number, and tuck full markdown/source details behind a collapsible section.
- Added an L1 lesson toolkit block to `/curriculum/[slug]` with direct links to key figures/glossary/worksheet/FAQ for in-class navigation.
- Aligned `library/lib-2` to `lib-5` with `読み方の目安` and more consistent classroom-facing notes to match `lib-1`.
- Improved `/people` list cards for classroom scanning: surface `覚える一言` first and move full memo/source blocks into collapsible sections.
- Rebuilt `/intro` as a practical entry page with quick-start steps, starter links (L1/figures/glossary/worksheet/FAQ), and an inline preview of the first lesson.
- Rewrote `ws-l1` to `ws-l6` from generic templates into lesson-specific worksheets aligned with L1-L6 objectives (observation, checking, data description, CA entry, safe breaching analysis, presentation planning).
- Expanded curriculum lesson toolkit links from L1-only to all lessons L1-L6, so each lesson page has direct links to relevant figures/glossary/worksheet/FAQ.
- Refined the home page (`/`) copy and labels to clear Japanese wording (AI workflow, 6-lesson timeline, and primary navigation cards) after earlier mojibake-heavy states.
